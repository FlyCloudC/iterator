# Yu-zh/iterator

This library implements both internal and external iterators.

* The package `@iter.T` is the internal iterator. It is almost a 1:1 copy of the
  `Iter` type of the MoonBit strandard library except that it can be transformed
  into an external iterator.

* The package `@ator.T` is the external iterator.
